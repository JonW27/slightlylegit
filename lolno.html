        <p>It's not that I don't want your money. Its simply that I'm writing this at 1AM in the morning after my fellow peeps kinda procrastinated their part. Also the british elections got in the way. If you still want the absolute full version (which I cannot guarantee to give), then please send a desperate email to my email address, stating that you'll pay me the amount. If there is enough demand, I'll think about it. Thanks, Jonathan.</p>
