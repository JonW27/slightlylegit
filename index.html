            <p>Ryan Tong<br>CEO<br><small>Ryan grew up in Afghanistan, and lost most of his relatives in a guerilla war. This profoundly affected him, as he realized that this was all the result of an exploitative capitalistic system. He set out to be a visionary by creating the first socialist company, where everybody, even the expendable, would be put on the team page.</small></p>
